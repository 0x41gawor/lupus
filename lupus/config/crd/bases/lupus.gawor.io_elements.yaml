                    https://github.com/0x41gawor/lupus/blob/master/docs/data-concept.md
                    Action is used in Element spec. Element has a list of Actions and executes them
                    In general each action has an input and output keys that define which Data fields it has to work on
                    Each type of Action has fields specific for it
                    Each action indicates the name of the next Action in Action Chain
                    There is special type - Switch. Actually, it does not perform any operation on Data, but rather controls the flow of Action Chain
