# LupN
LupN (Loop Notation) - is a language to design/express any loop workflow.

## What is workflow?
![](../_img/28.png)

As we can see Workflow is a chain of actions connected in a single direction. Sometimes the next node (action) of chain results from condition expression.

The actions we can see above instruct people, what to do on external (in relation to loop) sources. In our case the external source is [Data](data-concept.md). Action specifies what to do with data. Each Action of Lupus is some Data modification ('nest', 'send', 'rename', 'remove', 'duplicate'). Also as you can see condition statements rely on external sources and again in our case we will rely/define conditions on Data contents. 

At the end, Workflow provides some result. In our case the "result" will be "coded" in Data. Also sometimes workflow ends in "no result" state. In our case it means no reconciliation in this loop iteration. So no Data will be passed to Execute. We distinguish then two types of exit. "Success" (Data is passed to Execute) and "Failure" (No actions to execute in this iteration).

We will use BPMN 2.0 to visually express our workflows (loops - as in this case it is "toÅ¼same")

## Single-path Loop

Expression of single execution path Loop (workflow) in LupN is easy and already developed -> Just list the actions in yaml file. Order of Actions execution will be determined by order on the list.

## Multi-path loop

Single execution paths means that loop in each iteration will execute the exact same set of Actions. In contrary, multi-path loop means that set of executed action can differ accross loop iterations. In order words, loop at some point can select from multiple path continuations or immediately halt the execution.

Here, we will design in BPMN as many test cases as possible, to see the big picture and later based on https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/control-flow-introduction/ come up with some LupN sytnax proposition.

### BPMN examples
#### Single Path
![](../_img/30.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
```
#### Two paths
![](../_img/29.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
2. A, D, E
```
#### Multiple paths
![](../_img/31.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
2. A, D, E
3. A, F, G
4. A, H, I
```

#### Termination
![](../_img/32.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
2. A
```

#### Additional step
![](../_img/33.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
2. A, D, B, C
```

#### Converging paths
![](../_img/34.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A, B, C
2. A, D, C
```

#### Loop in loop
We do not allow such functionality.

#### Mixing it all
![](../_img/35.png)

Possible paths:
```sh
1. A
2. A, B, F
3. A, B, G, H
4. A, C, D, H
5. A, C, E, D, H
```

## Attemps of Syntax creation
### Flow
#### 1.
```yaml
actions:
  - name: A
    spec: AAA
  - xor: after-A
      cond1: B
      cond2: C
      cond3: exit
  - name: B
    spec: BBB
  - xor: after-B
      cond1: F
      cond2: G
  - name: C
    spec: CCC
  - xor: after-C
      cond1: D
      cond2: E
  - name: E
    spec: EEE
  - name: D
    spec: DDD
  - name: H
    spec: HHH
  - name: exit
  - name: F
    spec: FFF
```
The idea where flow is inferred from sequence fails in my opiniion. Better to explicitly state in each action what is the next element.

#### 2.
```yaml
actions:
  - name: A
    type: regular
    spec: AAA
    next: xor-A
  - name: xor-A
    type: xor
    spec:
      - cond1: B
      - cond2: C
      - cond3: exit
  - name: B
    type: regular
    spec: BBB
    next: xor-B
  - name: xor-B
    type: xor
    spec:
      - cond1: F
      - cond2: G
  - name: C
    type: regular
    spec: CCC
    next: xor-C
  - name: xor-C
    type: xor
    spec: 
      - cond1: D
      - cond2: E
  - name: F
    type: regular
    spec: FFF
    next: exit
  - name: G
    type: regular
    spec: GGG
    next: H
  - name: D
    type: regular
    spec: DDD
    next: H
  - name: E
    type: regular
    spec: EEE
    next: D
  - name: H
    type: regular
    spec: HHH
    next: exit
```

`regular` means action like `Nest`, `Rename` etc. the ones that actually modify the Data.
`xor` special type of Action that actually controls the flow instead modifies the Data.

in `xor` type next field will just be omitempy'ied.

One thing of syntax is to express flow. This is what we've done above. The next thing is to express the condition itself. Few remarks:
- I think it will have 3 fields: Data key, operator and value. E.g.
- Interpreter will check each condition one by one if it is true. If yes, jump to indicated Action. If not check the next condition. At the end the default says where to go if no condition returned true.
- It is designer role to design it properly, we only give tool.
- If there is type mismatch between field and value just return error.


### Conditions

Come up with some examples like checking the value of field `authorized` if false exiting the loop. checking the field `next_act` if A, go to action A, if B, go to B etc.. If field `ram` gt (greater than) `10` go to action critical-situation etc...

We will express such loop in our notation. Take a look that we need to distinguish between failure exit and success exit.

```yaml
actions:
  - name: "A"
    type: regular #regular means that this action is not special type 'xor'. It is rather one of {'nest', 'send', 'rename', 'remove', 'duplicate'}
    spec: AAA     # spec is specific to concrete action type and is not important here
    next: "xor-next-act"
  - name: "xor-next-act"
    type: xor
    spec:
      conditions:
        - key: "next_act"
          operator: eq #equals
          value: "B"
          next: "B"
        - key: "next_act"
          operator: eq
          value: "C"
          next: "C"
        - key: "next_act"
          operator: eq
          value: "D"
          next: "D"
      default: exit # failure exit
  - name: "B"
    type: regular
    spec: BBB
    next: finish # success exit
  - name: "C"
    type: regular
    spec: CCC
    next: "xor-ram"
  - name: "D"
    type: regular
    spec: DDD
    next: "xor-ram"
  - name: "xor-ram"
    type: xor
    spec:
      conditions:
        - key: "ram"
          operator: gt #greater than
          value: 10
          next: "critical"
      default: "normal"
  - name: "critical"
    type: regular
    spec: CRCRCR
    next: "ask_perm"
  - name: "normal"
    type: regular
    spec: NRNRNR
    next: "ask_perm"
  - name: "ask_perm"
    type: regular
    spec: APAPAP
    next: "xor-perm"
  - name: "xor-perm"
    type: xor
    spec:
      conditions: 
        - key: "perm"
          operator: ne # not equals to
          value: false
          next: finish 
      default: exit
```

It is a little bit overwhelming and very error-prone. Some tool that checks syntax validity (and draws a workflow) will be necessary.
