# abstraction
the process of hiding unnecessary details to focus on [data](#data) and [information](#information) that is relevant for defining a particular concept or process.
# action
set of operations that may be performed on a set of managed entities, it represents a transformation or processing in the system being modelled
# actor
role, played by an external entity (human or machine), which interacts with the subject of a use case
# agent
computational process that implements the autonomous, communicating functionality of an application
## software agent !
software that acts on behalf of a user or another program
## software autonomous agent
software agent that acts on behalf of the entity that owns it without any
communication from the owning entity
## software intelligent  agent
software agent that reasons about its environment and take the best set of actions
to satisfy a set of goals
## software multi-agent
set of software agents that are physically separate that work together to satisfy a set of
goals
# anomaly
measurable consequences of an unexpected change in state of a datum, or set of data, which is outside of its
local or global norm
# API 
set of communication protocols, code and tools that enable one set of software components to interact with either
a human or a different set of software components
# API Broker !
software entity that mediates between two systems with different APIs, enabling the two different systems
to communicate transparently with each other

# architecture !
set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of a system:

## cognitive architecture !
system that learns, reasons, and makes decisions in a manner resembling that of a
human mind
## deliberative architecture !
 symbolic world model that enables problem-solving components to be built using a
sense-plan-act paradigm
## functional architecture
model of the architecture that defines the major functions of each module and how
each module interacts with each other
## hybrid architecture
system made up of reactive and deliberative components that are combined into a
hierarchy of interacting layers, where each layer reasons at a different level of abstraction
## reactive architecture
system that is aware of changes that affect its computations and adjusts accordingly
## software architecture
high-level structure and organization of a software-based system. This includes the
objects, their properties and methods and relationships between objects
# Artificial Intelligence (AI) !
computerized system that uses cognition to understand information and solve problems
# assisted system
system that the ENI system is providing recommendations and/or management commands to is
referred to as the "assisted system"
# attention
part of a neural architecture that dynamically computes a weighted distribution on input text, assigning
higher values to more relevant elements 
# autonomous network !
: set of self-governing programmable and explainable systems that seamlessly deliver secure,
context-aware, business-driven services that are created and maintained using model-driven engineering and
administered by using policies
# Autonomous Network Responsibility Index (ANRI)
level of responsibility delegated to the AN in all the Operational
Procedures bind to the lifecycle management of each Autonomous Domain and E2E Service
# axiom
statement that is assumed to be true, in order to serve as a starting point for further reasoning
# behaviour ! 
way in which a set of objects function (This includes how the object reacts in a particular situation given one or more events. )
# bias
systematic difference in treatment of certain objects, ideas, or people in comparison to others
# capability
type of metadata that represents a set of features that are available to be used from a managed entity
# case-based reasoning
use of existing experiences and knowledge to understand and solve new problems
# choreography
set of processes that define how entities interact from a global point-of-view
# closed loop control ! 
self-regulating mechanism in which outputs of a system are provided to a system that compares
the current state to a desired state (or set of states); the comparison is then used to adjust the behaviour of the system

NOTE 1: Positive feedback increases the correction value, while negative feedback reduces the correction value.

NOTE 2: Positive and negative feedback can be combined to achieve the needs of a system. In addition, more
complex forms of closed loop control exist, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. See
control theory. 
# cognition
process of understanding data and information and producing new data, information and knowledge
# compute node
object that performs a set of calculations according to a set of algorithms
# control loop !
mechanism that senses the performance of an object or process being controlled to achieve desired
behaviour: 

- adaptive closed control loop: closed control loop whose controlling function adapts to the object or process
being controlled using parameter that are either unknown and/or vary over time
- closed control loop: control loop whose controlling action is dependent on feedback from the object or
process being controlled
- cognitive closed control loop: closed control loop that selects data and behaviours to monitor that can help
assess the status of achieving a set of goals, and produce new data, information, and knowledge to facilitate the
attainment of those goals
- distributed closed control loop: closed control loop whose components are physically distributed among
different locations
- federated closed control loop: set of semi-autonomous closed control loops that use formal agreements to
govern their interaction and behaviour
- hierarchical closed control loop: closed control loop that is organized in the form of a tree
- open control loop: control loop whose controlling action is independent of the output of the object or process
being controlled
- peer closed control loop: two or more closed control loops that may interact, but are independent of each
other
