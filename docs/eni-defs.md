NOTE 1: This is defined in MEF 55 [i.4], but also see MEF PDO CfC [i.2] and [i.15].

- **declarative policy:** type of policy that uses statements from a formal logic to describe a set of computations

- **ENI Policy Rules**: set of imperative, declarative, and/or intent policy rules
- **imperative policy**: type of policy that uses statements to explicitly change the state of a set of targeted objects
  NOTE 2: The canonical form of an imperative policy is a triple, consisting of a set of Event, Condition, and Action
