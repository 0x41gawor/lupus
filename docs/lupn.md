# LupN

LupN is a notation for expressing the loop-workflow. Note that it cannot express the whole loop-logic since the computing-part of it is sewn in the external-blocks. Hence, LupN does not full specifies the external-elements but only a references to them. But as for sure LupN fully specifies the [lupus-elements](defs.md#lupus-element).

From the Kubernetes/implementation point of view a LupN notation file is actually a YAML manifest file of [lupus-master](defs.md#lupus-master).
